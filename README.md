# Fontozy

This project is based on Chad Mazzola's Beautiful Web Type(http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type), a website that showcases some of the author's favorite fonts from Google Fonts, a content delivery network (CDN) for a collection of free fonts. Inspired by his work, I wanted to present my own collection of free and well designed fonts. They can be found at Google Fonts or FontSquirrel, which provides an even larger selection of free fonts. Unlike Google Fonts, however, FontSquirrel unfortunately does not provide a CDN service for their fonts, so users must download the fonts they want and include them via CSS3's @font-face(http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_fonts.asp) rule.
